# Description

Multi-user chat system using asynchronous pub/sub pattern. Each user should be authenticated and authorized to receive certain messages in a system. 

There are 4 abstract authorization levels: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`. User level `C` can see level `C` and `D` messages, user level `A` can see everyones' messages.

Each user before sending/receiving a message should prove his/her identity via authentication. Authentication is implemented via JWT.

# Tech stack

Backend and frontend parts are in the same repository (monorepo). 

The backend is written in Go and the frontend in React (javascript).

### Level C user:

username: C

password: 123

### Level D user:
